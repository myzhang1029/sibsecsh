# SIB Secure Shell

[![unsafe forbidden](https://img.shields.io/badge/unsafe-forbidden-success.svg)](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/safety-dance/)

Secure 2FA shell, reimplemented in Rust.
This project replaces former [sibsecsh.sh](https://github.com/myzhang1029/codes/blob/main/shell/sibsecsh)
and [sibsecsh.py](https://github.com/myzhang1029/codes/blob/main/python/sibsecsh.py).

It is called `sibsecsh` because it was originally written to protect my [Shell in a Box](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox) instance.
